In Python, classes let you group together data and behavior by defining attributes and methods, respectively. Typically, a class contains both attributes and a set of methods that add functionality. But what if you have a class that storesâ€”a lot of attributesâ€”with almost no functionality? Do you still need to use regular classes, or is there a better alternative? 

**Data classes**, first introduced in Python 3.7, provide a more convenient way of defining and managing such **data-oriented classes** (who would've guessed!).

**If you already have a Python class that exposes a lot of methods, you don't need a data class**. However, if youâ€™re interested in learning about this new feature to manage your data-oriented classes better, then this tutorial is for you.

Youâ€™ll learn the basics of data classes and how theyâ€™re different from regular Python classes. In addition, youâ€™ll learn how data classes support type hints, default values beyond basic data types, immutability, and more.

Letâ€™s get started!

#### ðŸ“‘ Before You Begin

To follow along, you need [Python 3.7 or a later version](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed in your preferred development environment. 

You can find the code examples used here in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/balapriyac/dataclasses-tutorial).

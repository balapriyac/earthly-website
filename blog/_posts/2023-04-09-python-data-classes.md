In Python, classes let you group together data and behavior by defining attributes and methods, respectively. Typically, a class contains both attributes and a set of methods that add functionality. **But what if you have a class that stores a lot of attributes with almost no functionality?** Do you still need to use regular classes, or is there a better alternative? 

**Data classes**, first introduced in Python 3.7, provide a convenient way of defining and managing such **data-oriented classes** (who would've guessed!).

**If you already have a Python class that exposes a lot of methods, you don't need a data class**. However, if youâ€™re interested in learning about this new feature to manage your data-oriented classes better, then this tutorial is for you.

Youâ€™ll learn the basics of data classes and how theyâ€™re different from regular Python classes. In addition, youâ€™ll learn how data classes support type hints, default values beyond basic data types, immutability, and more.

Letâ€™s get started!

#### ðŸ“‘ Before You Begin

To follow along, you need [Python 3.7 or a later version](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed in your preferred development environment. You can find the code examples used here in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/balapriyac/dataclasses-tutorial).
  
This tutorial assumes youâ€™re familiar with the working of [Python classes and objects](https://earthly.dev/blog/how-cls-obj-work-python/).

## Python Classes and Boilerplate Code

Youâ€™ll first create a regular [Python class](https://earthly.dev/blog/how-cls-obj-work-python/). In doing so, you'll realize how much bolierplate code you need to write to get a minimal working class. You'll then rewrite the existing Python class as a *data class* to understand how data classes can help you escape the monotony of boilerplate code.

As our goal is to *understand and use* data classesâ€”and not to write fancy classesâ€”let's create a simple class such as a `Student` or an `Employee` class.

So which class do we pick: `Student` or `Employee`? 

![student-vs-employee-class]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/5.png)\

Iâ€™ll choose `Student` class for now. Let's get coding!

### The `__init__` Method

Letâ€™s create a `Student` class with the attributes: `name`, `roll_no`, `major`, and `year`. To initialize instances of the `Student` class by passing in values for these attributes in the constructor, you can define the `__init__` method:

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
# main.py
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, roll_no, major, year):
        self.name = name
        self.roll_no = roll_no
        self.major = major
        self.year = year
~~~

Now that youâ€™ve created the `Student` class, start a Python REPL, import the `Student` class, and create a student object `jane`:

~~~{.python caption=""}
>>> from main import Student
>>> jane = Student('Jane','CS1234','Computer Science','junior')
~~~

You inspect this object `jane` at the REPL: 

~~~{.python caption=""}
>>> jane
<main.Student object at 0x007EE628>
~~~

As seen, the default representation returned `<main.Student object at 0x007EE628>` is not very helpful; it does *not* contain any information on the attributes of the instance `jane`. If you need a helpful string representation of the object, you should implement the `__repr__` method. 

### Adding a Helpful `__repr__`

Letâ€™s add a `__repr__` method that returns a string containing the values of the instance attributes:

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Student: {self.name} {self.roll_no} {self.major} {self.year}"
~~~

After adding the `__repr__`, the `Student` class should look like this:

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
# main.py
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, roll_no, major, year):
        self.name = name
        self.roll_no = roll_no
        self.major = major
        self.year = year

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Student: {self.name} {self.roll_no} {self.major} {self.year}"
~~~

Now go back to the REPL and look at the `__repr__` for `jane`:

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
>>> jane
Student: Jane CS1234 Computer Science junior
~~~

That's much better! 

But remember, *you* added the `__repr__` method. *So it's only as helpful as you choose to make it*. You can as well write a `__repr__` that only returns the string "Student object". Clearly, such a `__repr__` is not more helpful than the default `<main.Student object at 0x007EE628>` (just saying!).

Next, create another instance of the `Student` class `also_jane` with the same values for the instance attributes:

~~~{.python caption=""}
>>> also_jane = Student('Jane','CS1234','Computer Science','junior')
~~~

You can verify the equality of the various attributes of `jane` and `also_jane`, like so:

~~~{.python caption=""}
>>> jane.name == also_jane.name
True
>>> jane.roll_no == also_jane.roll_no
True
>>> jane.major == also_jane.major
True
>>> jane.year == also_jane.year
True
~~~

**But what happens when you try to compare `jane` and `also_jane`?**

~~~{.python caption=""}
>>> jane == also_jane
False
~~~

Well, `jane == also_jane` returns `False`. **Why?**

![why]({{site.images}}{{page.slug}}/1.png)\

By default, the **==** operator compares the IDs of the two objects. And comparison of objects in terms of attributes doesnâ€™t make sense until you implement the `__eq__` method. Okay, let's do that!

### Implementing the `__eq__` Method

For now, we know the following:

- Comparison is valid *only* between two objects belonging to the *same* class. 
- The values of the various instance variables of the two objects should be equal.

Letâ€™s define the `__eq__` method to compare any two instances of two instances of the `Student` class:

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
 def __eq__(self, another):
        if self.__class__ == another.__class__:
            return (self.name, self.roll_no, self.major, self.year) == (
                another.name,
                another.roll_no,
                another.major,
                another.year,
            )
        else:
            return "InvalidComparison"
~~~

When you try to check if `jane == also_jane` after adding the `__eq__` method, you'll see that it evaluates to `True` as expected:

~~~{.python caption=""}
>>> jane == also_jane
True
~~~

To create `Student` class with *four* attributes, a helpful string representation, and support for object comparison, we have the following in main.py:

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
# main.py
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, roll_no, major, year):
        self.name = name
        self.roll_no = roll_no
        self.major = major
        self.year = year

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Student: {self.name} {self.roll_no} {self.major} {self.year}"

    def __eq__(self, another):
        if self.__class__ == another.__class__:
            return (self.name, self.roll_no, self.major, self.year) == (
                another.name,
                another.roll_no,
                another.major,
                another.year,
            )
        else:
            return "InvalidComparison"
~~~

Suppose you need to add the GPA for each student, remove the `name` attribute and add two new attributes: `first_name` and `last_name`, the list of classes each student has taken, and a bunch more. 

**What do you do next?**

- You need to first update the `__init__` method. Cool. 
- Howâ€™ll you remember the newly added attributes if you donâ€™t add them to the `__repr__`? Okay, so youâ€™ll go and modify the `__repr__`. 
- Oh wait, you should update the `__eq__` method, too.

Clearly, it's not super fun anymore!

And as you keep modifying the class, you'll *likely* forget to update one of these. No, I'm not challenging you!

## How to Create Data Classes in Python

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Student:
    name: str
    roll_no: str
    major: str
    year: str
    gpa: float
~~~

~~~{.python caption=""}
>>> from main import Student
>>> jane = Student('Jane','CS1234','Computer Science','junior',3.98)
~~~

~~~{.python caption=""}
>>> jane
Student(name='Jane', roll_no='CS1234', major='Computer Science', year='junior', gpa=3.98)
~~~

~~~{.python caption=""}
>>> also_jane = Student('Jane','CS1234','Computer Science','junior',3.98)
>>> jane == also_jane
True
~~~

### Create Data Classes With `make_dataclass`

To create a data class, you can also use `make_dataclass` from the dataclasses module:
  
~~~{.python caption=""}
from dataclasses import make_dataclass
Student = make_dataclass('Student',['name','roll_no','major','year','gpa'])
~~~
However, I prefer using the `@dataclass` decorator; the code is a lot easier to read and maintain, especially when there are many fields.

In Python, classes let you group together data and behavior by defining attributes and methods, respectively. Typically, a class contains both attributes and a set of methods that add functionality. But what if you have a class that storesâ€”a lot of attributesâ€”with almost no functionality? Do you still need to use regular classes, or is there a better alternative? 

**Data classes**, first introduced in Python 3.7, provide a convenient way of defining and managing such **data-oriented classes** (who would've guessed!).

**If you already have a Python class that exposes a lot of methods, you don't need a data class**. However, if youâ€™re interested in learning about this new feature to manage your data-oriented classes better, then this tutorial is for you.

Youâ€™ll learn the basics of data classes and how theyâ€™re different from regular Python classes. In addition, youâ€™ll learn how data classes support type hints, default values beyond basic data types, immutability, and more.

Letâ€™s get started!

#### ðŸ“‘ Before You Begin

To follow along, you need [Python 3.7 or a later version](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed in your preferred development environment. You can find the code examples used here in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/balapriyac/dataclasses-tutorial).
  
This tutorial assumes youâ€™re familiar with the working of [Python classes and objects](https://earthly.dev/blog/how-cls-obj-work-python/).

## Python Classes and Boilerplate Code

Youâ€™ll first create a regular [Python class](https://earthly.dev/blog/how-cls-obj-work-python/). In doing so, you'll realize how much bolierplate code you need to write to get a minimal working class. You'll then rewrite the existing Python class as a *data class* to understand how data classes can help you escape the monotony of boilerplate code.

As our goal is to *understand and use* data classesâ€”and not to write fancy classesâ€”let's create a simple class such as a `Student` or an `Employee` class.

So `Student` or `Employee`?

Iâ€™ll choose `Student` class for now. Let's get coding!

### The `__init__()` Method

Letâ€™s create a `Student` class with the attributes: `name`, `roll_no`, `major`, and `year`. To initialize instances of the `Student` class by passing in values for these attributes in the constructor, you can define the `__init__()` method:

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
# main.py
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, roll_no, major, year):
        self.name = name
        self.roll_no = roll_no
        self.major = major
        self.year = year
~~~

Now that youâ€™ve created the `Student` class, start a Python REPL, import the `Student` class, and create a student object `jane`:

~~~{.python caption=""}
>>> from main import Student
>>> jane = Student('Jane','CS1234','Computer Science','junior')
~~~

You inspect this object `jane` at the REPL: 

~~~{.python caption=""}
>>> jane
<main.Student object at 0x007EE628>
~~~

As seen, the default representation returned `<main.Student object at 0x007EE628>` is not very helpful; it does *not* contain any information on the attributes of the instance `jane`. If you need a helpful string representation of the object, you should implement the `__repr__()` method. 

### Adding a Helpful `__repr__()`

After adding the `__repr__()`, the `Student` class should look like this:

~~~{.python caption="main.py"}
# main.py
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, roll_no, major, year):
        self.name = name
        self.roll_no = roll_no
        self.major = major
        self.year = year

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Student: {self.name} {self.roll_no} {self.major} {self.year}"
~~~
